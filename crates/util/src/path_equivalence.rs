//! Filesystem-identity-aware path comparison.
//!
//! Standard byte-level path comparison (`Path::strip_prefix`,
//! `Path::eq`) treats two paths as equal only when their bytes match.
//! That's wrong for many real systems where two distinct byte sequences
//! resolve to the same on-disk file:
//!
//! - **Android mount-bind aliases**: `/data/user/0/<pkg>` and
//!   `/data/data/<pkg>` are two independent mount entries that the
//!   kernel points at the same inode. Neither is a symlink at the
//!   `readlink(2)` level, so `std::fs::canonicalize` is a no-op for
//!   both forms. They CAN be distinguished only via `stat()` —
//!   `(st_dev, st_ino)` is identical.
//! - **macOS firmlinks**: `/var` ↔ `/private/var`, `/tmp` ↔
//!   `/private/tmp`. Same shape: kernel-managed equivalence with no
//!   user-visible symlink.
//! - **User-created symlinks**: `~/projects/foo -> /elsewhere/foo`.
//!   Canonicalize works for these, but inode comparison also covers
//!   them and is the simpler universal primitive.
//! - **NFS hard links, bind mounts the user set up themselves,
//!   bind-mounted host dirs into chroots, future filesystem trickery**:
//!   anything that aliases an inode.
//!
//! Symptom when this isn't handled: callers that store a path under
//! one form ("Zed opened a worktree at `/data/user/0/<pkg>/projects/x`")
//! and look it up under another form ("LSP server inside chroot
//! published diagnostics for `/data/data/<pkg>/projects/x/main.java`")
//! get `Option::None` back and silently drop the lookup result. Hard
//! to debug because both paths exist, both stat successfully, and
//! `ls` shows the same content — just the bytes don't match.
//!
//! This module provides one primitive — [`PathIdentity`] — and one
//! algorithm — [`strip_prefix_by_identity`]. Anywhere two paths need
//! to be compared semantically rather than byte-equality, use these.
//! Cross-platform (Unix and Windows); falls back to no-op on platforms
//! without the metadata API needed.
