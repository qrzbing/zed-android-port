//! Pointer-capture event synthesis.
//!
//! When `MainActivity.kt` calls `decorView.requestPointerCapture()` and
//! it succeeds, the trackpad delivers raw `MotionEvent`s to our
//! `OnCapturedPointerListener` instead of being filtered through
//! Android's gesture-detector layer. Captured events arrive tagged
//! `SOURCE_TOUCHPAD` (not `SOURCE_MOUSE`) with full multi-touch state,
//! per-pointer `AXIS_RELATIVE_X/Y` deltas, and clean
//! `ACTION_BUTTON_PRESS` / `ACTION_BUTTON_RELEASE` framing.
//!
//! This module turns that raw stream into the gpui `PlatformInput`
//! vocabulary so the editor sees normal `MouseMove` / `MouseDown` /
//! `MouseUp` / `ScrollWheel` events. We keep our own cursor position
//! (the system cursor is hidden while capture is active) and update it
//! by accumulating per-event relative deltas. Single-finger motion
//! moves the cursor; two-finger motion synthesizes a scroll from the
//! centroid delta and pins the cursor in place.
//!
//! ## Event flow
//!
//! Kotlin builds a `CapturedEvent` from each captured `MotionEvent` and
//! calls `nativeOnCapturedPointer` (JNI). The Rust handler pushes the
//! event onto a static unbounded channel; the platform's main loop
//! drains the channel each iteration and feeds the synthesized
//! `PlatformInput`s into the primary window's `handle_input`. Cross-
//! thread because Kotlin's listener fires on the UI thread but
//! `handle_input` must run on the game thread.
//!
//! ## Gestures (matching desktop trackpad standards)
//!
//! Single-finger:
//! - Plain tap (DOWN → UP within `TAP_WINDOW`, motion < `TAP_MOTION_PX`):
//!   synthesize `MouseDown(Left)` + `MouseUp(Left)` at cursor — left
//!   click.
//! - Tap-tap-drag (per libinput/Windows Precision Touchpad standard):
//!   plain tap, then a second `ACTION_DOWN` within `TAP_DRAG_WINDOW`
//!   of the first tap-up near the same position. On the first MOVE
//!   past `TAP_DRAG_SLOP`, emit `MouseDown(Left)` at the tap anchor
//!   and treat subsequent motion as click-and-drag. ACTION_UP ends
//!   the drag. This is how text selection / rubber-band / drag-and-
//!   drop is invoked on every major desktop trackpad spec.
//! - `ACTION_BUTTON_PRESS` (Samsung's driver-recognized drag): emit
//!   `MouseDown(Left)`, follow with MouseMove(Left held), release on
//!   `ACTION_BUTTON_RELEASE`. Coexists with tap-tap-drag for
//!   trackpads that don't emit BUTTON_PRESS reliably in capture mode.
//!
//! Two-finger:
//! - Quick tap-tap (both fingers down + up within `TWO_FINGER_TAP_WINDOW`
//!   with low motion): right-click at cursor.
//! - Hold-and-drag: finger 1 is on the pad for at least
//!   `HOLD_DRAG_THRESHOLD` before finger 2 lands. Synthesize
//!   `MouseDown(Left)` at finger 1's anchor on `ACTION_POINTER_DOWN`,
//!   accumulate finger 2's relative deltas into an internal drag
//!   cursor, emit `MouseMove(Left held)` at the drag cursor on each
//!   MOVE, and release on either pointer lifting. This is how
//!   Samsung's stock trackpad driver recognizes click-and-drag, and
//!   matches what users observe on Android trackpads when selecting
//!   text. Discriminates from scroll because scroll lands both fingers
//!   near-simultaneously (hold-elapsed < threshold).
//! - Move (both fingers landed near-simultaneously): scroll. The
//!   centroid delta drives `ScrollDelta::Pixels`. Sign matches
//!   `events/trackpad.rs` so behavior is consistent with the
//!   non-captured trackpad path.
