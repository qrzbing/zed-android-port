//! Mouse input translation. Buttons, wheel, hover, drag.

//! Android pre-resolves trackpad / mouse multi-finger gestures and
//! physical buttons into `MotionEvent.button_state`. A two-finger tap on
//! the Galaxy Book Cover trackpad arrives here as a single pointer with
//! `BUTTON_SECONDARY` set; physical right-click on a USB mouse arrives the
//! same way. We honor `button_state` directly so the user doesn't have
//! to do anything special with a trackpad.
