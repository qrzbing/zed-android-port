//! Input-source classification.
//!
//! Android tags every `MotionEvent` with both a device source bitmask
//! (`Source::Mouse`, `Source::Touchscreen`, …) and a per-pointer
//! `ToolType` (`Mouse`, `Stylus`, `Finger`, …). The two don't always
//! agree: a stylus on a touchscreen reports `SOURCE_TOUCHSCREEN` but
//! `tool_type=Stylus`, and a mouse on the same device shows up the
//! same way until DeX mode. `ToolType` is finer-grained, so we prefer
//! it when present and fall back to the device source.
//!
//! We collapse all of that into a 4-way [`InputSource`] enum that the
//! rest of the translator branches on. Three reasons callers care:
//!
//! 1. **Per-source multi-click windows.** A hardware mouse should match
//!    `ViewConfiguration.getDoubleTapTimeout()` (~300ms) and tight
//!    slop (≤3 logical px). Finger taps need ~500ms / ~6px because
//!    real fingers are slower and noisier than mice.
//! 2. **Hover semantics.** Touch contact should not paint mouse-hover
//!    styles. (Currently handled implicitly: Android only delivers
//!    `HOVER_*` from mouse/stylus sources, so we already bail out for
//!    touch. This classifier is here for future explicit branches.)
//! 3. **Pointer-capture decisions.** Samsung Book Cover trackpad in
//!    tablet mode reports as `Source::Mouse` with relative motion;
//!    if we ever request `requestPointerCapture()`, we'll branch on
//!    `Touchpad` to enable it without affecting actual hardware mice.
