//! Click + button-state tracking shared by mouse and touch dispatchers.
//!
//! Three pieces of state:
//! - **Primary anchor.** Position + time the primary button (mouse Left,
//!   first finger) went down. Drives `finalize_up` so a release knows
//!   which button to emit.
//! - **Held non-primary.** Set when the dispatcher emits a non-primary
//!   button-down (right / middle / nav). The matching Up resolves to
//!   the same button rather than defaulting to Left.
//! - **Last click run.** Time + position + button + run length of the
//!   most recent Down. A new Down within the source-specific window +
//!   slop bumps the run length; the editor's word- / line-select keys
//!   off the resulting `click_count`.
//!
//! Per-window owned (lives as a field on `AndroidWindowState`). Each
//! window has its own click state so a tap in window A doesn't bleed
//! into window B's double-click run.
//!
//! Renamed from `events/touch.rs` once `crate::touch` arrived: the
//! state here is actually generic click-tracking shared between
//! modalities, not touch-specific.
