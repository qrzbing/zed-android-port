//! First-class native touch gesture state machine.
//!
//! Touch on Android (`SOURCE_TOUCHSCREEN` + `ToolType::Finger`) arrives
//! through android-activity's NDK native input queue and is dispatched
//! from `platform.rs`'s `InputEvent::MotionEvent` handler. Standard
//! Android app code would lean on Java's `GestureDetector` for tap /
//! scroll / longpress classification, but `GameActivity` removes the
//! `AInputQueue` and the framework gesture helpers along with it, so we
//! hand-roll the SM here. Same approach as Unity / Unreal / Godot and
//! Google's own NDK `gestureDetector.h` sample.
//!
//! Peer of `captured_pointer.rs` (captured-trackpad SM). Mouse, stylus,
//! and the captured-trackpad path still flow through their existing
//! dispatchers; only the `InputSource::Finger` branch routes here.
//!
//! Gesture vocabulary (Phase 1; longpress-selection lands in Phase 4):
//! - 1-finger tap → `MouseDown(Left)` + `MouseUp(Left, count=1+)`
//! - 1-finger drag → cancel pending Left + `ScrollWheel(...)` per frame
//! - 1-finger longpress → keeps `Left` held (no synthetic right-click;
//!   collides with text selection)
//! - 2-finger tap → cancel pending Left + synthesize Right click sequence
//! - 2-finger drag → `ScrollWheel` from centroid relative-delta
//!
//! State ownership: `TouchState` is a field on `AndroidWindowState`.
//! Both primary and extra-window surfaces own their own `TouchState`,
//! so gestures in different windows can never interfere. No
//! thread-locals, no global mutable state — lifetime is bound to the
//! window struct.
//!
//! Input normalization: the SM operates on a `TouchEvent` (this
//! module's own type), not Android's `MotionEvent`. Primary surface
//! events arrive as NDK `MotionEvent`; extras as JNI-marshaled
//! `(action_masked, positions, ...)` tuples. Both build a `TouchEvent`
//! via the local helpers and feed it to the same `on_event` SM. One
//! state machine, two sources, fully testable in isolation.

// Trackpad mode (VNC-style virtual trackpad)
// ============================================================================
//
// When `android_input.trackpad_mode` is enabled, the screen acts as a
// virtual trackpad rather than direct touch:
//
//   - 1-finger tap (no significant motion before lift) → click at the
//     virtual cursor's current position (`MouseDown` + `MouseUp`).
//   - 1-finger drag → advance the virtual cursor by the touch delta
//     and re-position the cursor sprite. No mouse button held.
//   - 2-finger tap → right-click at the cursor.
//   - 2-finger drag → `ScrollWheel` based on centroid Y-delta.
//
// The virtual cursor lives on Kotlin's side (`MainActivity.cursorX/Y`,
// same SurfaceControl overlay the hardware trackpad uses) and we keep
// a Rust-side mirror in `TrackpadTouchState::cursor` so the emitted
// `MouseDown`/`MouseMove` events have the correct position. Each move
// fires a JNI call to `MainActivity.setTrackpadCursorPosition` to
// keep the sprite in sync.

/// commits the gesture to drag (cursor motion); below it, lift is a
/// tap (click at cursor).
