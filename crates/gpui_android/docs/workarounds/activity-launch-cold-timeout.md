# Cold Activity launch timeout (4 seconds)

**Status:** Active
**Phase / Commit:** L7
**Files:** `crates/gpui_android/src/multi_window.rs` (`ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT`)

## Problem

`Platform::open_window` is synchronous in gpui's contract — it must return
a `Box<dyn PlatformWindow>` before the App update completes. Our
`open_extra_window` blocks the gpui game thread on a oneshot waiting for
JNI `surfaceCreated` after launching ExtraWindowActivity.

If the launch stalls (system busy, OOM, dex-mode transition logic), the
game thread freezes forever. At ~5 seconds Android fires an ANR
(Application Not Responding) dialog.

## Constraint

Cold ExtraWindowActivity start in DeX freeform windowing on Snapdragon 8
Gen 2 measured at:

| Trial | Cold launch latency |
|---|---|
| 1 | 530ms |
| 2 | 560ms |
| 3 | 2030ms |
| 4 | 2070ms |

The 2-second outliers happen when Android is doing transition / app-kill
work concurrently. So a 500ms or 1000ms timeout fires too eagerly. A 5s+
timeout risks the game thread freeze the user notices as input lag.

Warm reopens (Activity already alive in Recents from a recent open):
~50-100ms. Trivial.

## Solution

Hard cap the wait at **4 seconds**, return `Err` on timeout:

```rust
const ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_millis(4000);

let deadline = std::time::Instant::now() + ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT;
loop {
    match rx.try_recv() {
        Ok(Some(native_window)) => return Ok(native_window),
        Ok(None) => { /* not ready yet */ }
        Err(_) => {
            pending_table().as_mut().and_then(|m| m.remove(&window_id));
            bail!("extra surface creation channel dropped (sender canceled)");
        }
    }
    if std::time::Instant::now() >= deadline {
        pending_table().as_mut().and_then(|m| m.remove(&window_id));
        bail!(
            "ExtraWindowActivity startup exceeded {}ms",
            ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT.as_millis()
        );
    }
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(8));
}
```

On timeout the gpui caller gets a clean error ("couldn't open Settings,
try again"). Better than a 4s freeze followed by a ghost window.

## Why this works

- 4s covers the 2030ms outliers we observed plus headroom.
- 4s is below Android's 5s ANR threshold for input dispatch.
- Warm reopens are 50-100ms so the cap only matters on first cold open per
  process lifetime.
- If we genuinely hit it, the user retries — the second tap is warm and
  will succeed.

## Failure mode if regressed

- **Timeout too short** (e.g. back to 500ms): every cold launch fails
  spuriously; user sees "couldn't open" on first tap.
- **Timeout too long** (e.g. 8s): game thread freezes longer than 5s on a
  stalled launch → Android fires ANR dialog.
- **No timeout**: stalled launch freezes editor forever; user force-stops.

- [Multi-Activity OS-chromed extra windows](multi-activity-os-chrome.md)
- L7g (deferred): split `WgpuRenderer` creation from surface presentation
  so `open_extra_window` returns synchronously. Replaces this timeout with
  proper async open.
