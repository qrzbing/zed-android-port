# SAF picker renders empty when Termux's DocumentsProvider is in a degraded state

**Status:** Active (external-app issue, recovery procedure documented)
**Phase / Commit:** Diagnosed during L9 (2026-05-05)
**Files:** None on our side. Recovery is `pm disable-user --user 0 com.termux && pm enable com.termux`.

## Symptom

`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` (and `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`, `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`)
fires the system DocumentsUI picker (`com.google.android.documentsui`),
but the picker lands at a top-level "Files on \<Device Name\>" /
"No items" empty view with the prompt **"Can't use this folder / To
protect your privacy, choose another folder"** at the top — regardless
of `EXTRA_INITIAL_URI`. **Use this folder** is greyed. The hamburger
sidebar drawer renders but its entries are unreachable.

This persists across `pm clear com.google.android.documentsui` and
`pm clear com.sec.android.app.myfiles` — neither flushes the bad state.
It also reproduces with **bare `adb shell am start -a
android.intent.action.OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`**, proving it's not Zed's
intent at fault.

Logcat shows
```
W ExternalStorage: Error in checking file equality check.
```
during the picker's root enumeration, which is the AOSP
`ExternalStorageProvider.isRestrictedPath`'s `Files.isSameFile()`
catch-all — but that warning is the *symptom*, not the cause.

## Root cause

Termux ships a `DocumentsProvider` (`com.termux.documents`, class
`TermuxDocumentsProvider`) registered against authority
`com.termux.documents` so other apps can browse Termux's `$HOME` via
SAF. When DocumentsUI builds its root list at picker startup, it queries
**every** registered SAF provider's `queryRoots`. If Termux's provider
hangs, throws, or returns a corrupt cursor, Mainline DocumentsUI's
defensive bailout path renders the empty Devices/overview view for the
entire picker session — not just for Termux's pane.

This was diagnosed by:
1. Confirming the picker is broken bare (no app intermediation, no
   `EXTRA_INITIAL_URI`).
2. `dumpsys content` shows `com.termux.documents/root` registered.
3. `pm disable-user --user 0 com.termux` → relaunch picker → picker
   renders /sdcard normally with all subfolders and **Use this folder**
   enabled.
4. `pm enable com.termux` (re-enable) → picker still works. The
   disable→enable cycle reset Termux's provider state.

The trigger we never definitively identified, but the most likely cause
is Termux's provider process getting force-stopped or its `onCreate`
crashing once on a corrupted bootstrap (Termux's `$HOME` having a
broken symlink, missing perms, etc.) — DocumentsUI then caches the
failure for the lifetime of the provider process.

## Recovery (manual)

If a user reports the SAF picker on Android 13+ with Termux installed
showing **"No items / Can't use this folder"** regardless of which
sidebar entry they tap and what initial URI is set:

```sh
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.termux
adb shell pm enable com.termux
```

Or via the device UI: Settings → Apps → Termux → Disable → re-enable.

**Don't uninstall Termux** — the user's `$HOME` lives in the package
data and uninstall wipes it. Disable/enable preserves data.

## Why we don't (yet) auto-fix this in Zed

- We can't run `pm disable-user` from a non-privileged Android app —
  it's a shell-level operation. With Magisk + `su` we could, but
  shipping Magisk-only code paths is out of scope.
- We can't disable our own DocumentsProvider in the same way and
  expect Termux to behave differently — the bug is in Termux's
  provider process, not ours.
- Detecting the broken state from inside Zed would require querying
  every SAF root via `ContentResolver` and timing each — invasive,
  flaky, and still doesn't *fix* anything; we'd just surface a banner
  saying "your SAF picker is broken, run this `adb` command."

The cleanest mitigation we ship is good docs (this file) plus the
Open menu's behavior of falling back to in-app navigation
(workspace start screen has Workspace + External sections that don't
go through SAF, so the user can still get to recent projects and
known shared paths even when the picker is broken).
