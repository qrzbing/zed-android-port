# Android port — workarounds library

Index of every non-obvious thing we do to make Zed run on Android. Each entry
points at a deeper writeup explaining the problem, the constraint that rules
out the obvious fix, and the chosen approach. **This file is the table of
contents; the writeups live alongside it.**

When a new constraint hits us and the workaround is non-trivial, add an entry
here so future sessions don't re-derive it from scratch. When a workaround
is replaced by something cleaner, mark it Reverted and link to the
replacement.

## How to read this

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | Currently shipping in the APK |
| **Deferred** | Designed, scheduled, not yet built |
| **Reverted** | Was active, replaced by something cleaner |

## Storage / filesystem

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [Noexec mount on /storage/emulated/0](android-noexec-mount.md) | Active | FUSE-mounted shared storage rejects execve regardless of file mode |

| [`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` stopgap](reverted-cargo-target-dir.md) | Reverted | Per-tool env redirect didn't generalize |

## Termux integration

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|

| [Termux env propagation into bash](termux-env-propagation-to-bash.md) | Active | alacritty's pty replaces inherited env; we copy TERMUX_*/PREFIX/PATH/LD_PRELOAD over explicitly |

## Node / npm / CLI tools

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [Node binary `NODE_PLATFORM` patch](node-platform-patch.md) | Active | Termux Node is built `--dest-os=android`; npm picks wrong optional deps |
| [npm intercept stack (wrapper + launcher generator)](npm-intercept.md) | Active | Generic per-binary classification kills `zed-setup-X` per-tool sprawl |
| [Hex-patch `/etc/resolv.conf` → `/sdcard/.zed/r`](hex-patch-resolv-conf.md) | Active | Bun-compiled CLIs' static-musl c-ares can't be LD_PRELOAD'd; rewrite the rodata literal so it opens our writable file instead |
| [JNI DNS bridge → `/sdcard/.zed/r`](jni-dns-bridge.md) | Active | Populates the file the hex-patch points at, sourced from Android's actual ConnectivityManager DNS |
| [`/sdcard/.zed/` namespace](sdcard-dot-zed-namespace.md) | Active | Why `/sdcard` (byte-width constraint) and why `.zed/` (hidden, namespaced) for the patched paths |
| [Claude Bun-binary patchelf + proot wrapper](claude-bun-binary-patchelf.md) | Superseded | Original claude-specific zed-setup-claude path. Replaced by hex-patch above. Kept for archaeology. |
| [LD_PRELOAD `libzed-compat.so` path-redirect shim](deferred-ld-preload-shim.md) | Dropped | Doesn't apply to static-musl (no PLT/GOT); replaced by hex-patch |

## Runtime env

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [HOME env dual-pointing](home-env-dual-pointing.md) | Active | Rust process needs HOME=data_path; bash needs HOME=$TERMUX__HOME |
| [Terminal HOME override](terminal-home-override.md) | Active | Pass TERMUX__HOME into bash without disturbing Rust globals |
| [SSL_CERT_FILE / CURL_CA_BUNDLE](ssl-cert-bundle.md) | Active | Cargo / npm / curl don't know about Termux's CA bundle on Android |
| [.gitconfig safe.directory = *](gitconfig-safe-directory.md) | Active | libgit2 dubious-ownership check fires for media_rw-owned /sdcard repos |
| [Activity-recreation idempotency](activity-recreation-idempotency.md) | Active | `android_main` re-enters; everything must be re-entrant |
| [SELinux context canary log](selinux-canary.md) | Active | Detect if `targetSdk` regresses by checking `untrusted_app_27` domain |

## UI / input

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [Choreographer-driven vsync](choreographer-vsync.md) | Active | Replaces 8ms fixed-interval polling with event-driven vsync |
| [Two-finger tap → right click](two-finger-rightclick.md) | Active | Touchscreens don't have a right mouse button |
| [JVM stack overflow on clipboard](jvm-clipboard-stack-overflow.md) | Active | Android's 988KB android_main thread can't handle clipboard JNI synchronously |
| [Soft-keyboard / IME bridge](deferred-soft-keyboard.md) | Deferred | Hardware keyboard works; touch IME bridge is its own engineering problem |
| [first_mouse=false on Android touches](first-mouse-tagging.md) | Active | macOS-style first-click-focuses-the-window logic was no-op'ing every touch handler |
| [UI mode → window appearance](ui-mode-system-appearance.md) | Active | Hardcoded Light made dark-mode-following themes always pick One Light |
| [AssetSource threaded through gpui_android::run](assetsource-icons.md) | Active | Without it, every icon rendered as a blank rectangle |
| [PointerIcon JNI cursor mapping](pointer-icon-cursor-mapping.md) | Active | set_cursor_style was a no-op; mouse hover never showed I-beam, resize handles, etc. |

## Window / render

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [`platform.rs` no-drain RefCell pattern](refcell-drain-platform-bug.md) | Active | Draining main_receiver inside `open_window` panics on RefCell re-entry |
| [Block open_window until ANativeWindow ready](open-window-blocks-on-anativewindow.md) | Active | Renderer races against surface creation if we don't wait |
| [Construct buffer inside open_window](construct-buffer-inside-open-window.md) | Active | Sibling of refcell-drain; buffer constructor needs to live under the same borrow |
| [wgpu device-lost recovery](wgpu-device-lost-recovery.md) | Active | Android GPU driver loses context under memory pressure; need explicit drop+recreate |
| [Force a paint after surface attach](force-paint-after-surface-attach.md) | Active | Fresh swapchain doesn't get an invalidation event; force one explicit paint |

## Multi-window (L7)

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [Multi-Activity OS-chromed extra windows](multi-activity-os-chrome.md) | Active | Each `cx.open_window` past the first becomes a separate Activity task → OS provides freeform chrome on DeX/desktop windowing |
| [`ZedApplication` for AppCompatActivity native lib load](zedapplication-loadlibrary.md) | Active | AppCompatActivity has no GameActivity meta-data hook → centralize `System.loadLibrary` in Application.onCreate |
| [JNI ClassLoader for app classes](jni-classloader-for-app-classes.md) | Active | `Class.forName` only sees framework classes; Activity's loader sees app classes |
| [JNI exception clear after error](jni-exception-clear-after-error.md) | Active | Pending Java exception from a failed JNI call aborts process on next JNI; must clear |
| [`futures::oneshot::Receiver::try_recv` semantics](futures-oneshot-tryrecv-semantics.md) | Active | `Ok(None)` means "not ready", not "channel dropped" — easy off-by-semantic bug |
| [Android 16 freeform configChanges (exhaustive)](android16-config-changes-resize.md) | Active | Drag-resize destroys Activity by default; declare every config to handle ourselves |
| [`appCategory="productivity"`](android16-app-category-productivity.md) | Active | Defang Android 16 games carve-out from desktop windowing — GameActivity inheritance could trip the heuristic |
| [`documentLaunchMode="always"` implies Intent flags](document-launch-mode-implies-flags.md) | Active | Setting both manifest mode AND explicit flags caused MainActivity to background under DeX |
| [Cold Activity launch timeout (4s)](activity-launch-cold-timeout.md) | Active | Cold ExtraWindowActivity start ~2s; cap synchronous wait below ANR threshold |
| [Process-death recovery for extra windows](process-death-recovery-extra-windows.md) | Active | Activities resurrected from Recents after process kill must self-`finish()` if Rust runtime doesn't know their windowId |
| [`ActivityOptions.setLaunchBounds`](activity-options-launch-bounds.md) | Active | Pass gpui's `WindowParams.bounds` to the OS so freeform windows open at the requested size |
| [`with_active_or_new_workspace` falls back to existing on Android](with-active-or-new-workspace-android-fallback.md) | Active | When Settings is the active window, theme picker / command palette / recent projects routed through `with_active_or_new_workspace` were spawning duplicate Workspace ExtraWindowActivities; redirect to the existing primary instead |
| [`activate()` via `AppTask.moveToFront`](activate-extra-activity-move-to-front.md) | Active | `Window::activate_window()` was a no-op stub on Android; settings_ui's existing-window dedup needed it to surface a backgrounded Settings instead of re-opening |
| [`ZedDocumentsProvider` exposes `~` as a SAF root](zed-documents-provider.md) | Active | Other apps couldn't browse / share files from `/data/data/<pkg>/files/home` via the system picker; ported Termux's provider shape with custom dev MIME map + search skip list + provider-pre-Activity `mkdirs` guard |
| [Notify `on_active_status_change` for cursor blink](notify-active-status-change.md) | Active | Editor's `cx.observe_window_activation` observer must fire to call `BlinkManager::enable`, otherwise search-bar cursor renders statically until first input |

## Build / packaging

| Workaround | Status | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| [Debug-strip oversized .so](debug-strip-oversized-so.md) | Active | llvm-strip chokes on >2 GB ELF; profile.dev workaround |
| [audio + livekit + call cfg-gates](android-cfg-gates.md) | Active | These crates don't compile against bionic; mock fallbacks already exist |
| [Load bundled themes via LoadThemes::All](load-themes-all.md) | Active | Default lazy-load left the theme picker empty on Android |
| [Load default Linux keymap on boot](load-default-linux-keymap.md) | Active | Android KeyEvents look closer to Linux than macOS — pick the right keymap |

## Adding a new workaround
