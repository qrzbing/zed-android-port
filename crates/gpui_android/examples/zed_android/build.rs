//! Build-time guard for the bootstrap-package-name invariant.
//!
//! Termux's bootstrap binaries hardcode `/data/data/<package>/files/...` in
//! every ELF's `DT_RUNPATH` and every shell shebang. Rebuilding the
//! bootstrap with `TERMUX_APP_PACKAGE=com.zdroid` bakes that exact
//! string into ~3 GB of binaries. If `applicationId` in
//! `android/app/build.gradle.kts` ever drifts from this constant, every
//! binary in the rebuilt bootstrap fails at runtime with `dlopen failed:
//! library "/data/data/com.termux/..." not found` — an afternoon of
//! head-scratching by the time it shows up in logcat.
//!
//! Make the mismatch un-compileable: read the gradle file, assert it
//! contains `applicationId = "<our package>"`. Only checks the gradle file
//! exists and contains the literal — does NOT pretend to be a kts parser.
//! AGP and we agree on the substring or we both panic.
