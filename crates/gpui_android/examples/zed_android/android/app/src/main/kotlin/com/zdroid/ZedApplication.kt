/// Loads the native library before any Activity starts. Required because
/// `ExtraWindowActivity` extends `AppCompatActivity` and does not trigger
/// the GameActivity meta-data path that loads `libzed_android.so`. With the
/// load centralized here, both activities can call into JNI on first touch
/// without per-Activity init blocks racing against Android's class-loader
/// when an Activity is recreated.
///
/// Also ensures `~` (the SAF root exposed by `ZedDocumentsProvider`)
/// exists before the system serves DocumentsUI queries. ContentProviders
/// attach earlier in the process lifecycle than Activities — when another
/// app opens DocumentsUI and Zed isn't running, Android forks our process,
/// runs `Application.onCreate`, then `ContentProvider.onCreate`, then
/// services queries — without ever instantiating `MainActivity` or
/// running `android_main`. The bootstrap extractor and env setup live in
/// `android_main`, so without this `mkdirs` the SAF picker would surface
/// "Zed" with an empty root the first time another app queries it.

        //      bootstrap extractor runs (cold provider queries succeed
        //      with at least one visible subfolder).
        //   2. The noexec-banner Copy-to-projects dialog has a real
        //      destination dir from the moment the user can interact —
        //      no race with `storage::setup_user_symlinks` which mkdirs
        //      the same path on the Rust side at android_main entry.
