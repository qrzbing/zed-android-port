# Zdroid backlog

Non-blocking UX / feature gaps to revisit after the current refactor lands. Tasks in the live task list are atomic and time-bound; this file is for "noted but not yet scoped" concerns.

## "Open Project" on first boot: SAF picker works, post-pick handoff drops the project on the floor

**Repro:** fresh install (or after `pm clear com.zdroid`). Go through onboarding, tap **Finish Setup**. Welcome page appears. Tap **Open Project**, SAF picker opens normally, pick a folder, return to the editor. **Nothing visibly changes** (still on Welcome). Close the app and reopen it; now the picked project loads and works normally.

So the action dispatch + SAF picker + Java -> Rust callback all work. The break is somewhere in the post-pick "replace this window's workspace with the new project" path.

**Code path** (after the SAF URI comes back via `Java_com_zdroid_MainActivity_onPickerResult` in `saf.rs:126`):

```
prompt_for_open_path_and_open                                   workspace.rs:721
  paths.await -> Some(picked)
  multi_workspace_handle = window.window_handle().downcast::<MultiWorkspace>()
  if !create_new_window && multi_workspace_handle.is_some():
      multi_workspace.open_project(paths, OpenMode::Activate)   multi_workspace.rs:1933
        if multi_workspace_enabled(cx):                          (true when agent settings enabled, default)
            find_or_create_local_workspace(...)                  multi_workspace.rs:1968
              -> Workspace::new_local(... OpenMode::Activate)
                -> [either reuse current window OR spawn new one
                    depending on serialized_workspace and the
                    1955 vs 1995 branch in workspace.rs]
            detach_workspace(empty_welcome_workspace)
```

**Likeliest cause:** `find_or_create_local_workspace` creates the new project workspace in a fresh MultiWorkspace window (= new `ExtraWindowActivity` on Android) instead of reusing the current MainActivity-hosted Welcome window. The Welcome window's empty workspace gets `detach_workspace`'d. The user is staring at MainActivity (which still has the now-detached Welcome surface) while the new project window opens off-screen / behind / in another freeform tile they don't notice.

That explains why "close + reopen" works: workspace-restore at next launch loads the most-recently-activated workspace state (= the project that was opened), so it materializes in the front MainActivity that time.

Adjacent symptom of the same class: the `with-active-or-new-workspace-android-fallback` workaround doc covers an earlier instance of this multi-Activity routing problem for action-dispatched modals (theme picker, command palette).

**Other possibilities to rule out with logs:**

1. `multi_workspace.open_project` returns Err silently (the `.log_err()` on line 763 of workspace.rs would swallow it).
2. The new workspace IS created in the current MultiWorkspace but `activate()` on line 1983 fails to switch the active workspace pointer, so the UI keeps rendering the empty Welcome.
3. The current MultiWorkspace's `active_workspace` was already replaced but the underlying `ExtraWindowActivity` SurfaceView isn't getting a fresh draw call.

**Diagnostic next step:** capture `adb logcat --pid=$(adb shell pidof com.zdroid)` from app launch through the failed Open Project flow. The signals to look for:

- `AndroidPlatform::prompt_for_paths invoked` -> action reached platform.
- `saf: pick_folder requested` then `saf: MainActivity.launchOpenTree() returned` -> SAF Intent dispatched cleanly.
- `saf: onPickerResult uri=...` -> Java callback fired with the picked URI.
- After that, anything mentioning `open_project`, `find_or_create_local_workspace`, `activate`, or new-window creation (search for `cx.open_window`, `ExtraWindowActivity` in logs) tells us whether a new window was spawned or the existing one was reused.

If we see a new-window spawn line, the fix is to force `OpenMode::Activate` to reuse the current MultiWorkspace's window on Android (probably in `multi_workspace.rs:open_project`, branch on `cfg(target_os = "android")` and pick a different path that doesn't call `find_or_create_local_workspace`).



## Reported via the @-mention bug-can't-be-filed loop (2026-05-13)

External user tried to file these and was blocked by upstream Zed's `blank_issues_enabled: false` + Discord-redirect contact_links (fixed in `244f29a455`). Logging here so they don't get lost while the user re-files via the new templates.

- **Mouse scroll direction reversed**: Samsung One UI + Bluetooth mouse. Scroll works correctly everywhere else on the device but is inverted in Zdroid. Likely a sign flip in `gpui_android`'s `MotionEvent` → scroll-delta translation. Check the wheel-axis path specifically (touch-pad two-finger scroll may differ); One UI may report `AXIS_VSCROLL` with a sign that mainline Zed doesn't compensate for. **Still open.**
- ~~**Vim mode broken**~~ — **fixed in 29b29ddd63** (key events now route from `ExtraWindowActivity` to gpui via `nativeOnExtraKeyEvent` JNI bridge; the root cause was that any extra window's `dispatchKeyEvent` was never forwarded so `PlatformInput::KeyDown` never fired). Vim and any other editor in a non-Main window now accepts typing.
- ~~**Settings searchbar typing broken**~~ — **fixed in 29b29ddd63** (same key-routing fix, plus a tap-to-focus wrapper on the search bar with `stop_propagation` so taps don't bubble to `SettingsWindow`'s focus tracker which was immediately blurring the bar).

## Runtime picker: adapter install-state UX (deferred)

The onboarding runtime-picker section (and the Settings page entry) currently presents all three adapters — Kali chroot, Bootstrap, External Termux — as selectable equals. On a fresh install the user almost certainly has NONE of them installed:

- **Chroot** requires Magisk + the `zdroid-spawnd` Magisk module (separate flashable zip from GitHub releases) + a Kali NetHunter chroot rootfs at `/data/local/nhsystem/kali-arm64`. None of those are bundled in our APK.
- **Bootstrap** requires the bootstrap zip (~240 MB) extracted into `$PREFIX`. Auto-extracted from the APK asset today, but per task #17 we're moving to GitHub-release download. If the asset isn't present, "Bootstrap" doesn't work either.
- **External Termux** requires the Termux app installed on the device AND the user granting `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND`. Plus our JNI Intent bridge (task #36) needs to land.

The picker doesn't surface any of this. A user tapping "Bootstrap" with no bootstrap installed sees: their selection saved, restart Zdroid, nothing works, no actionable feedback. Same for chroot without the Magisk module. Worst-case UX.

**Bridge needed:**

- Show an install-state badge per adapter (Installed / Missing / Partial).
- For Missing: link out to the install instructions (GitHub release page, F-Droid Magisk module link, Termux Play Store/F-Droid).
- For Partial (e.g., chroot module installed but rootfs path is empty): explain what's missing AND what to do.
- Consider whether to install silently (downloads bootstrap zip on selection) or surface as an opt-in download with progress.
- "Auto-install" vs "show options" — likely the right answer is BOTH, with auto-install gated behind explicit user consent because: bootstrap is 240 MB, chroot requires Magisk + root, external Termux needs a separate app install. Silent install is hostile to discoverability and bandwidth control.

The chroot adapter already has health-check hints in `RuntimeProvider::health_check()` — `HealthStatus::NotInstalled { hint }` with links to the spawnd release page. The picker UI just doesn't surface these yet. Wiring through to the inline section would give us the install-state-aware UX without inventing new infrastructure.

**Related tasks already in the live list:**

- #33 — wire settings UI for adapter selection
- #34 — first-launch onboarding modal (now landed as the inline basics_page section, but install-state UX is still TBD)
- #36 — JNI Intent bridge for external Termux adapter
- #37 — bootstrap install/uninstall (GitHub releases download)

Resolve this AFTER the Termux-divestment refactor (tasks #74-80) lands. Once each adapter is a first-class peer with a proper install flow, the picker can surface that flow.

## Settings search bar input pipeline (deferred)

Tapping the settings search bar on Android doesn't bring up the soft keyboard and the Editor never receives input events. Probe instrumentation in `crates/settings_ui/src/settings_ui.rs` shows:

- Editor entity is created (we see `editor created` at boot)
- A `Blurred` event fires after the user taps, but no `Focused` event reaches the subscribe handler
- No `InputHandled` / `InputIgnored` / `Edited` events

So the Editor IS getting focused (Blurred can only fire after a Focused state), but the focus is being stolen immediately, AND the Android InputMethodManager (soft keyboard) is not being prompted. Two suspected layers:

1. **GPUI / gpui_android focus handling**: the on_click handler I added (focus the editor handle on bar click) appears to set focus but lose it instantly. Could be the welcome page or some other view stealing it back via focus rules.
2. **Android IME wiring**: even if focus stays on the Editor, the soft keyboard doesn't open. Zed-the-app needs to call `InputMethodManager.showSoftInput()` (Java/JNI) when an Editor gains focus on Android. This wiring is in gpui_android's platform layer and may be incomplete.

Diagnosing requires instrumenting gpui_android's input layer too, not just the editor subscription. Probably want JNI logs on `onWindowFocusChanged`, `dispatchKeyEvent`, and `InputMethodManager` calls. Out of scope for the Termux-divestment refactor; pick up after Phase 8.

Visible workaround for users today: there isn't one — search filter is effectively dead on Android. Settings remain navigable via the sidebar tree.

## Image paste into the agent panel doesn't work on Android

**Repro:** copy an image to the Android clipboard (screenshot share-sheet "Copy to clipboard", or copy from Files / Gallery / a browser). Open the agent panel in Zdroid, focus the message editor, paste. Nothing happens. Text paste works fine.

**Diagnosis:** not a permission or storage gap. The Android clipboard bridge at `crates/gpui_android/src/clipboard.rs` is text-only by design; the module doc calls this out explicitly (`ClipboardItem` can carry images and structured entries, but our editor only round-trips text through it). `read()` calls `getPrimaryClip()` and pulls `getText()` off item 0; any `image/*` MIME entries on the clip are silently discarded before they ever reach gpui.

**Consumer:** the agent panel's message editor at `crates/agent_ui/src/message_editor.rs:278` is the only path that consumes `ClipboardEntry::Image`; `crates/agent_ui/src/mention_set.rs:931` is the same hook from the mention resolver. The editor itself doesn't accept image paste, so the wiring only matters when the agent panel is focused.

**Wiring needed:**

1. Extend `clipboard::read_inner` to inspect `ClipDescription.getMimeType(i)` for each item. If `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, or `image/gif`, treat it as image instead of falling through to `getText()`.
2. Pull the `content://` URI from `ClipData.Item.getUri()` and open it via `ContentResolver.openInputStream(uri)`. The clipboard system auto-grants read access to the receiving app for as long as the clip is active, so no `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` plumbing on our side.
3. Read the full byte stream, map MIME to `gpui::ImageFormat`, return `ClipboardEntry::Image(Image::from_bytes(format, bytes))`. `gpui::Image` is just `format + bytes`, no decode required on the platform side.

**Implementation constraints:**

- The existing `read()` runs on the gpui render thread with a 50ms JNI cache because cx.read_from_clipboard is polled at 60fps for the Paste menu's enabled state. Reading multi-megabyte screenshots through JNI on the render thread risks the same `android_main` stack overflow the doc warns about. Push image reads onto the 2MB-stack worker pattern already used by `write_on_worker` and stash the resolved `Image` in the cache so subsequent polls don't re-read.
- Cache invalidation: bumping the read cache TTL or attaching a clipboard-change listener (`OnPrimaryClipChangedListener` via JNI) so we know when to drop the cached image without polling MIME types every 50ms.
- Decoding format mapping: prefer the MIME from `ClipDescription`; fall back to magic-byte sniffing if absent (rare on Android but Termux clipboard managers sometimes paste raw bytes without a description).

**Adjacent (not yet needed):** write path for images. Copy-image-out is much less common in editor flows; only worth wiring once a consumer exists.

**Scope estimate:** ~200 LoC in `crates/gpui_android/src/clipboard.rs` plus ~30 LoC of JNI helpers. `ContentResolver.openInputStream` is one of the fiddlier JNI surfaces; the `InputStream` object needs an `available()` + `read(byte[])` loop or `Channels.newChannel`. Single-file change otherwise. Half a day if the JNI byte-read path lines up first try, full day if we trip ANR-territory issues on big screenshots.

**Why deferred:** core editor flow works without it, and the agent panel feature gating depends on `supports_images` from the LLM provider anyway. Pick up once a user reports a concrete blocked workflow.

## MCP / context-server integration is absent on Android

**Repro:** add a `context_servers` block to Zdroid's `settings.json` (the syntax Zed uses upstream for stdio or HTTP MCP servers). Restart the app. Nothing happens. No server is spawned, no tools surface in any panel, no entry appears under Settings; the editor reads the JSON but no code path consumes the block. Adding the same block on desktop Zed works.

**Diagnosis:** the wiring is missing at three layers, in order:

1. **Boot skip.** `crates/gpui_android/examples/zed_android/src/lib.rs` around line 1003 explicitly lists `agent_ui` / `copilot` / `language_models` as out-of-scope on Android ("Skipped from production"). The agent panel is the entry point that registers MCP-related actions and observes the `context_servers` settings block; without `agent_ui::init` running, none of that fires.
2. **Cargo dep absent.** The example's `Cargo.toml` doesn't declare `agent_ui` or `context_server` as dependencies, so the upstream MCP transport implementations (`crates/context_server/src/transport/{stdio_transport,http}.rs`) aren't even linked into Zdroid's `.so`. There is no `McpClient`, no `ContextServerStore` instance in the process at any point.
3. **Subprocess spawn gap.** Even if 1 and 2 land as-is, the upstream stdio transport spawns the configured MCP server with `tokio::process::Command`, which on Android lands as a bionic-spawn from the editor process. That path does not see the active runtime adapter's `$PATH`, `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or chroot scope, so any MCP server that ships as a Bootstrap-userland or chroot binary (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`, `uvx mcp-server-time`, anything else realistic) fails to exec.

**Wiring needed:**

- Add `agent_ui` + `context_server` (and the transitive `language_models`, `assistant`, etc. that won't compile without it) to `crates/gpui_android/examples/zed_android/Cargo.toml`.
- Initialize `agent_ui::init` in `boot()` past the "AI skipped" comment band. Confirm the agent-panel + workspace action wiring actually fires on Android; the editor compiles agent surfaces today via cfg-gates to mocks, but full init likely surfaces side effects (LLM provider registration, settings observers, etc.) that we have not exercised.
- Route the stdio-transport spawn through `zdroid_runtime` so the configured MCP server inherits the active adapter's environment. Easiest path: replace the upstream `tokio::process::Command` invocation with a call that goes through our existing `zd-exec` wrapper (`crates/zdroid_runtime/src/bin/zd-exec.rs`); the wrapper already handles chroot/bootstrap/external Termux selection. Either patch upstream's transport with an Android cfg-gate, or wrap the `MCPCommand` config builder.
- Decide what to do with the LLM provider gate. MCP servers are useful even without a model talking to them (tool execution, prompt management), so a "BYO key, no provider configured" mode is viable. Alternatively gate MCP UI visibility behind a configured provider so the no-key state is not confusing.

**Why deferred:**

- The README and roadmap already declare AI panels out of scope. The MCP gap is downstream of that declaration; closing it pulls the entire `agent_ui` / `language_models` surface back in scope, which is a meaningfully larger commitment than just the MCP wiring.
- Daily-driving the editor today does not require MCP. Most of what people want from MCP on Android specifically (filesystem access, shell tools) is already reachable via the integrated terminal + the relevant runtime adapter, so users have a working workaround.
- The right time to do this is once we either (a) ship a real LLM-panel integration so MCP arrives with a sibling consumer, or (b) deliberately decide to surface MCP tools standalone (slash commands? command palette entries?) without the assistant.

**Scope estimate:** rough 2-3 days end-to-end. Cargo dep additions and `agent_ui::init` are short. The real time sink is debugging the side effects of bringing the agent surface online for the first time on Android (focus / window routing, settings store observers that assume desktop platforms, the LLM provider registration path on a platform that has historically been mock-only). Pair with [[project-zed-android-port]] phase planning when picking this up.

## Soft keyboard / IME bridge (touch-only users blocked)

**Repro:** open Zdroid on a device without a hardware keyboard. Open a project, tap into an editor. Nothing happens. No keyboard appears, no way to type. Hardware-keyboard flow works fully; touch-only flow is blocked at "I cannot enter text." First organic external feature request was about this.

**Diagnosis:** hardware key path is wired end-to-end in `crates/gpui_android/src/events/keyboard.rs` (translates Android `KeyEvent` to gpui `PlatformInput::KeyDown`). The hook for IME exists on the gpui side: `crates/gpui_android/src/window.rs` already implements `set_input_handler` / `take_input_handler` (lines 524-530) and a route at line 376-382 inserts text into the active `PlatformInputHandler` for any `PlatformInput::KeyDown` with `key_char` set. Missing is the Android side: nothing calls `InputMethodManager.showSoftInput()`, nothing provides an `InputConnection`, nothing routes IME callbacks back to gpui.

**Failed approach (2026-05-16, reverted at commit-level, captured here so the next attempt does not repeat):**

Tried wiring a `BaseInputConnection` on a 1×1 invisible `View` subclass (`ZdroidInputView`) attached as a sibling to GameActivity's SurfaceView under `decorView`. The view overrode `onCheckIsTextEditor()` to return true and `onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo)` to return a custom `BaseInputConnection` with `IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI | IME_FLAG_NO_FULLSCREEN | TYPE_CLASS_TEXT | TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_MULTI_LINE | TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS`. JNI bridge in a `crates/gpui_android/src/ime.rs` module called `MainActivity.showSoftKeyboard()` / `hideSoftKeyboard()` from `set_input_handler` / `take_input_handler`. Manifest got `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustNothing"` to stop resize-on-IME.

Failure modes observed on device:

1. **Launcher dock visibly flashed through the SurfaceView during IME slide-in.** Still happened with `adjustNothing`. Suggests the SurfaceView is being detached or its visibility briefly compromised by the IME's window-level effects, not by manifest resize behavior. Root cause was not the resize.
2. **Wild glitching in DeX freeform / windowed mode.** The IME window placement conflicts with the app's freeform window placement; layout shifts incoherently. The IME wants the bottom edge of the screen, the app wants the bottom edge of its freeform window, and the system arbitrates badly.
3. **Samsung Keyboard's floating-keyboard option crashed or closed when activated.** The IME's floating-window anchor became unstable, suggesting the InputConnection view was being attached / re-attached during the IME show cycle.
4. **Critical: `commitText` / `sendKeyEvent` callbacks never fired** even though the keyboard was visible and the IME's predictive bar showed the typed characters (so the IME was registering keystrokes internally). This means the IME was not routing to our `BaseInputConnection` at all. Possible cause: GameActivity's SurfaceView is the actual focus target the IME picks, and our 1×1 sibling view's `requestFocus` is overridden / lost by the time the IME negotiates `InputConnection`.

The architectural mistake was treating GameActivity's SurfaceView as opaque and adding a sibling view in parallel. GameActivity owns the focus and input model end-to-end; bolting on a parallel `InputConnection` provider does not compose. The IME ends up targeting either GameActivity's default fallback connection or no connection at all.

**Recommended path forward: use AGDK's `GameTextInput`.**

The `androidx.games:games-activity:3.0.5` dependency we already declare ships `GameTextInput`, an official Google-supported native IME bridge specifically designed for GameActivity. It manages the `InputConnection` internally against GameActivity's actual focused view, exposes a native callback API (no Kotlin `BaseInputConnection` subclass needed), and coordinates with GameActivity's surface lifecycle correctly so the symptoms above go away by construction.

Key APIs:
- `GameActivity_setInputConnection()`: install the IME connection against GameActivity's real focus target
- `GameTextInputState`: struct populated by IME callbacks (commit, composing, selection)
- `GameActivity_setTextInputState()`: push current cursor / surrounding text to the IME for predictive accuracy
- `GameActivity_setSoftKeyboardVisibility(bool)`: show / hide

The `android-activity` crate (which we use) wraps a subset of GameActivity APIs. Verify whether it exposes these IME-related symbols; if not, either upstream a wrapper or call via JNI to the GameActivity `getJavaInstance()` object. Avoid building anything that adds a second focusable view to the hierarchy.

**Phasing once the right primitive is picked:**

1. **Phase 1: `GameActivity_setSoftKeyboardVisibility(true)` works.** Editor focus → keyboard appears reliably, no glitch, no dock flash, no freeform incoherence. The InputConnection is managed by AGDK against GameActivity's real SurfaceView focus target. Tests on phone + tablet + DeX.
2. **Phase 2: GameTextInputState → gpui's PlatformInputHandler.** Subscribe to text-state-change callbacks; on every committed character, call `state.input_handler.replace_text_in_range(None, text)` on the active window. Typing works end-to-end.
3. **Phase 3: Composing text** for Pinyin / Japanese / Korean IMEs. Wire `GameTextInputState`'s composing region into gpui's marked-text APIs (`replace_and_mark_text_in_range`).
4. **Phase 4: Selection sync.** Push current Editor cursor / surrounding-text via `GameActivity_setTextInputState` so soft-keyboard predictive suggestions are accurate. Requires gpui Editor to expose surrounding-text-at-cursor.

**Scope estimate:** 3-5 days end-to-end for phases 1+2 (the user-visible v1: "soft keyboard appears, typing works"). Phases 3-4 are polish, can ship in a follow-up.

**Why deferred:** unblocks the touch-only demographic but hardware-keyboard users (the daily-driver case so far) are unaffected. First external feature request named this. Adjacent: see [README's "What doesn't work yet"](README.md) which already lists this as a known gap; the README + this entry need to stay in sync.

## Other deferred concerns

(add new sections here as they come up; keep each one self-contained with what / why / what's-needed-to-resolve)
